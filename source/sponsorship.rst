Sponsorship levels
------------------

We're offering sponsorship at the following levels:

 * Gold, £9,995, includes ten tickets and a fifteen-minute sponsored keynote
   slot
 * Silver, £4,995, includes five tickets and a five-minute sponsored lightning
   talk slot
 * Bronze, £1,995, includes two tickets

All sponsors will be eligible to have a booth in the Marble Hall from Friday to
Monday and take part in the jobs fair.

We will promote all sponsors on social media and in the conference newsletter,
and will place sponsor logos on our website and on signs around the conference
venue.  We will also make space in the conference booklet for advertisements
from sponsors.


Process for contacting potential sponsors
-----------------------------------------

All conference organisers are encouraged to contact potential sponsors!

There is a spreadsheet for tracking the progress with contacting sponsors in
the conference Google Drive shared folder.  Please let Peter or George know if
you don't have access to this.

If you see a company in the spreadsheet where you know somebody who works there
(particularly if the status is "no response" or "stale") please let the person
in the handler field know.

Feel free to claim any companies where the handler field is blank by filling
out this field.

If you are listed as the handler for a company, please keep the the spreadsheet
up to date!

The spreadsheet has the following columns:
