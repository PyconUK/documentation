Daniele has set up a form with the following questions:

Talk details
------------

  No help text
Abstract

  Options: Talk; Workshop or tutorial; Code clinic, lunchtime event or other themed gathering; Poster
Audience Level

Description
  The description is the public abstract of your talk. The description will be seen by reviewers during the CFP process and will eventually be seen by the attendees of the event.
  You should make the description of your talk as compelling and exciting as possible. Remember, you're selling both the organizers of the events to select your talk, as well as trying to convince attendees your talk is the one they should see.
Notes
  Notes will only be seen by reviewers during the CFP process. This is where you should explain things such as technical requirements, why you're the best person to speak on this subject, etc...
Tags
  Talk your talk to make it easier for event organizers to be able to find. Examples are "ruby, javascript, rails".
