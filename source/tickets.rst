Tickets
=======

We are selling tickets at two prices: £96 for people who are paying for their
own tickets (individual tickets), and £144 for people whose company is paying
(company tickets).  Additionally, we are selling one-day tickets at £36.  These
prices include VAT.

We will ask the following questions on the registration form:

* Name
* Employer (but only for company-supported tickets)
* Email address
* Phone number
* Accessibility requirements
* Childcare requirements
* Dietary requirements

For assessing diversity (is there a better way to phrase that?) we should ask
about the following, but make responses optional:

* Gender
* Ethnicity
* Country of residence
* Age
