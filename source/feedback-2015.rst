Feedback From PyCon 2015
========================

**Core Issues From 2015**

*The percentages next to each point in the below list is the percentage of people which shared similar views. The list is in order of the most mentioned, to the least; only the top 10 have been taken.*

1. Talks running over their slots or cutting it fine, not allowing people to change rooms. (18.3%)
    - This comment appeared the most throughout the feedback. It was mentioned that this issue is also escalated when a speaker runs over their time slot. Changing rooms involved interrupting a speaker when entering.
2. Food quality wasn't favoured, and there was a lack of healthy snacks. (13.7%)
    - Healthy snacks was mentioned many times, and the general quality of the food at meal times.
3. Drinks repeatedly ran out (especially water) (10.3%)
    - Variety of drinks was also raised in other bits of feedback. People wanted more options than tea, and coffee. However, they didn’t mention water as another option we had available so maybe this is related to the shortage.
4. No printed schedules (10.3%)
    - This was an issue for those without smart phones. Some within the feedback mentioned that they would have been happy to pay the printing costs to get a printed schedule.
5. Signage to rooms wasn’t clear (9.1%)
    - It was said that it was difficult to find rooms which talks were in, and that maybe a map would be a good solution.
6. 30 Minutes for talks was not enough (9.1%)
    - Talks that were this long seemed either too ambitious, or too much as though it was a README.md without enough depth
7. Variation of foods at meal times (8.0%)
    - Vegetarian options, and vegan options were seen as limited. Although it was mentioned that the effort was appreciated.
    - Also the variety of breakfast and desert was raised, not as much however. 
8. No information regarding the target audience (Beginner, Advanced, etc) (6.8%)
    - This appeared as though it would have been very useful information to the attendees. It would allow then to go to talks which were closer to their knowledge level
9. Venue was over capacity (6.8%)
    - This was already known
10. Length of serving times and queues in the food queue (5.7%)

***Education Track Specifically 2015**

1. Organising the Raspberry PI’s (not enough)
