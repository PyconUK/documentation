Guidance for speakers
---------------------

We will need to give guidance to speakers about what to expect.

This will need to include:

- How long they are speaking for, including time for questions
- The likely size of the audience
- How questions will work (including giving them the option of not having questions)
- What kind of A/V equipment there will be
- Whether their talk will be filmed
- How they can get mentorship/advice from established speakers

We can turn this into an email after we've notified speakers that they're speakers
