Programme of talks
==================

At PyCon UK 2015, we had approximately 70 talks.

About 57 of the speakers were male, and the vast majority were of course
extremely white.

Some of our best friends are white men, and there is nothing wrong with
us^wthem, but all the same some of best friends are not, and for some reason the
ones who aren't didn't come forward to speak at PyCon.

The simple solution to this is to get more of our friends who are not white men
to propose talks.

Target
------

I will be disappointed if at this PyCon we don't receive at least **one-third of
our talk proposals from women**, and a substantial improvement in the
representation of other PyCon minorities amongst the talk applicants.

This is not impossible to achieve, by any means.

PyCon US:

* 2011: about 1% of speakers were women
* 2014 and 2015: about one-third were women

DjangoCon Europe:

* 2014: two our of 32 speakers were women
* 2105: approximately one-third of speakers were women
* 2016: approximately one-half of speakers are women

It's less easy to put numbers to other under-represented groups.


How I want to achieve this
--------------------------

In a nutshell, by encouraging people in under-represented groups to submit more
talks.

Specifically (all of these things have been tried, tested and successful):

* having published `diversity <http://2015.djangocon.eu/welcome/diversity/>`_
  and `accessibility <http://2015.djangocon.eu/welcome/accessibility/>`_ policies
* making `a big deal <http://2015.djangocon.eu/news/how-are-we-doing/>`_ of the
  fact that we want a more diverse speaker line-up
* asking particular people to submit proposals
* making it clear that selected speakers who need financial assistance will get
  at least some
* open ticket sales and the CFP to under-represented groups `early
  <http://2015.djangocon.eu/news/registration-opens/>`_
* setting up a `speaker mentor scheme
  <http://2015.djangocon.eu/proposals/speaker-mentors/>`_ to help speakers who'd
  like it
* providing and advertising a quiet room at the event
* providing and advertising a `cr√®che
  <http://2015.djangocon.eu/news/free-creche/>`_
* providing and advertising speech-to-text transcription (may depend on budget)
* stressing that PyCon will be an oaf-free-zone, and that the code of conduct
  will be taken very seriously
* making it clear that attendee well-being matters (`for example
  <http://2015.djangocon.eu/news/wellbeing/>`_)

Obviously not all of these things are the remit of the programme officer...


Proposed programme of talks
---------------------------

Talks will run from Friday 16th to Sunday 18th September, possibly alongside workshops and other activities on all days.
