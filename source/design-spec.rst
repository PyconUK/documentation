Design Specification
====================

We plan to reuse the structure of last year's website, but with updated design.
In addition, we would like the design to be adaptable for other things, such as:

 * stickers;
 * posters and signage;
 * slides;
 * social media.

So, we'd like:

 * a colour palette that we can use;
 * a main image for the website homepage and our Twitter background;

   * it should be a bit shorter than what we have right now on http://www.pyconuk.org/, which takes up a little too much height;
   * it should include the snake characters in Doctor Who outfits, and the PyCon UK crown;

 * some smaller images, with and without the snakes, that can be used on other pages on the website and elsewhere.
