Launching the conference
========================

Hi everyone,

I'm delighted to announce the launch of `PyCon UK 2016 <http://2016.pyconuk.org/>`_!

The conference will run from 15th-19th September at `Cardiff City Hall <http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/>`_, with a programme of talks, workshops, and other events aimed at the whole Python community.

More details are on the `conference website <http://2016.pyconuk.org/>`_, where you can `buy a ticket <http://2016.pyconuk.org/tickets/>`_ or `submit a proposal <http://2016.pyconuk.org/cfp/>`_ for a talk or a workshop.

We have worked hard to ensure the conference is more affordable than recent years.  Tickets start at Â£96 for the weekend, and we are offering `financial assistance <http://2016.pyconuk.org/financial-aid/>`_ to help people who would struggle to afford a ticket or other expenses.

The website's code is on `GitHub <https://github.com/pyconuk/2016.pyconuk.org>`_.  If you find any problems, please submit an issue or a pull request.

If you run a local user group, please share this email with your members.

We look forward to seeing you in Cardiff in September!

~ Peter, on behalf of the PyCon UK Committee
