Regular tickets were available until 1/7/15, after which Full Price tickets
were available.

Community tickets were supposed to be for those who spoke or who volunteered
their time during or before the conference, and were limited in number.
Additional Speaker tickets were released after these had been sold.  The
process for this was pretty unclear, and several speakers ended up paying
higher rates without knowing that a lower rate was available.

Student/Unwaged tickets were given to those who applied for them.  I'm not
quite sure how this was handled.

Several sponsors were eligible for free tickets.
