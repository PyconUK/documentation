# PyCon UK 2016 Internal Docs

Document _all_ the things!


## What is this?

Documentation for those involved in making PyCon UK 2016 happen.

Organising the event? You'll want this

Interested in volunteering? You'll hopefully find this useful, but shouldn't _need_ it

Just looking to attend the conference? You probably want the public site!


## Building

```
$ tox -e build
```

or, if you want an auto-building preview with webserver:

```

```
